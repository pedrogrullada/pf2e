You and each ally who ends their turn within the emanation gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until they leave the emanation or the spell ends, whichever comes first. If an ally takes physical damage or damage from a spell or magical effect while being granted this bonus, they can choose to end the bonus for themselves as a free action to gain resistance 10 to all damage against the triggering damage. If they do, they become temporarily immune to the effects of <em>shielding formation</em> for 10 minutes. You can do the same by spending your reaction; if you do, you can't cast <em>shielding formation</em> again for 10 minutes, though you can continue Sustaining the benefits for others.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Shielding Formation]</p>"
