Doing so summons a cloud of ghostly spirits in a @Template[type:burst|distance:30]. All creatures within the cloud become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. The spirits deal @Damage[8d6[void]|options:area-damage|traits:manipulate,occult,void] damage to each creature who enters or begins their turn in the cloud (@Check[fortitude|basic|dc:35|options:area-effect|traits:manipulate,occult,void]). You are unaffected by the cloud. This effect lasts 1 minute or ends if an adjacent creature spends an Interact action to knock the baton over.</p>"
