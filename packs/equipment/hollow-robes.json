They feature multiple stylish layers, voluminous sleeves, and long strings of Thassilonian runes along the hems. The robes employ potent illusion magic, sufficient to convince the wearer and any attackers that a devastating blow is nothing more than a flesh wound.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Empty Robes</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentration)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The wearer becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible] inside the robes for one minute. Since the wearer's gear (including the robes) remain visible, they don't become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed], but they can't be visually identified unless the viewer can see invisible creatures.
