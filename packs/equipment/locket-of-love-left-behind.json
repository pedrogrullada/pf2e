The locket reminds you that no matter how terrible the ravages of war are, you have something very important to live for. While wearing the necklace, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds when you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] condition. If you are dying, the DC of recovery checks is reduced by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”True Love's Power</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You would die due to a death effect rather than the dying condition</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Your love pulls you back from the brink of death and the locket cracks. You avoid dying and remain at 1 Hit Point. You cannot use the ability again until you replace the casing of the locket, which typically takes around 1 month and costs 600 gp.</p><hr /><p><em>PFS Note:</em> Replacing the casing of a <em>locket of love left behind</em> takes 30 days of Downtime.</p>"
