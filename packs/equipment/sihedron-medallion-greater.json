            "value": "<p>These amulets once served as tokens of loyalty between the runelords and their favored agents. Though they vary in appearance, they all share a common design—a leather or metallic cord attached to a metal disc inscribed with the seven-pointed star known as the Sihedron. For original <em>Sihedron medallions</em> created before Earthfall, a runelord of old Thassilon (not a character with the runelord archetype) doesn't reduce the DC of any @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Scrying] spell they cast against a creature that wears a <em>Sihedron medallion</em> even if they have never met the target or are unaware of the target's identity. If such a runelord successfully scries on a creature wearing an original <em>Sihedron medallion</em>, they can use the wearer's voice to issue messages to those in the vicinity. <em>Sihedron medallions</em> created in more modern times don't possess this disadvantage.</p>\n<p>A dead body that wears a <em>Sihedron medallion</em> doesn't decay, and bugs or other pests (such as maggots) are prevented from consuming the remains, but unlike the effects of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Peaceful Rest], this doesn't offer any protection against undeath, nor does it have an impact on spells that require the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Bolster Flesh</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Your flesh is augmented with magical vitality.
