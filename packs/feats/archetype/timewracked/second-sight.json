Spend a Mythic Point, then make a check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge] at mythic proficiency about a creature you can see. This check gains the following additional effects.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You learn all the actions the creature will take on its next turn (or in the first round of combat if combat hasn't begun), such as \"Stride toward Seelah\" or \"Cast shield.\" These actions are locked in and the creature must attempt them, even if the situation changes, though it need not perform the actions in the order stated. For instance, if the creature locked in the actions \"Stride toward Seelah,\" \"Make a longsword Strike against Seelah,\" and \"Raise a shield,\" and Seelah spent her turn moving adjacent to the creature, the creature can make the longsword Strike as its first action if it wishes. If the creature is unable to fulfill an action it committed to, it loses that action as it reels from a temporal paradox. If the situation changes drastically (perhaps Seelah becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible] and the creature is unaware where Seelah is), the GM determines what happens. during the turn that just ended (excepting the reaction you used to trigger Preserve the Moment), including the die roll results (not the actual check results). Die rolls you made as a result of others' actions on you or from the environment are not recorded. For example, if you Stride up to a firewyrm, roll a basic Reflex save against its intense heat aura, then Strike the firewyrm with a longsword, and then Climb up an adjacent wall, when you activate Preserve the Moment you record only the Stride action, the Strike action (and the die roll result you roll for the Strike), and the Climb action (and the die roll result you roll for the Athletics check to do so); you do not record your Reflex save against the aura's effects. Preserve the Moment works best, as a result, when the actions you take are relatively standard and when rolls associated with those are high rolls. You gain the following reaction, which you can use once during the next 24 hours. Restore the Moment ? (mythic, occult)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your turn begins</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Spend a Mythic Point. Take the same actions in the same order, using the same die roll results to resolve those actions, as you did in the preserved moment, and apply modifiers to those rolls as they currently exist (not as they were when you recorded the loop), but at mythic proficiency. The exact details of how you accomplish your restored actions can changeâ€”you need not move in the exact same pattern or distance with a repeated Stride, for example, nor must you make a repeated Strike against the same foe you attacked in the first set of actions, but you do need to use the same type of movement when you Stride, and you do need to use the same type of weapon to Strike. If at any point during your turn you are unable to take the next action in the loop, your turn ends and you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}. For example, if you restored the above example against the firewyrm in a round where you were fighting an ogre and you weren't able to attempt a Strike with a longsword against the ogre as your second action, you would become stunned 1. Likewise, if at the end of your turn there was nothing for you to try to Climb, you would become stunned 1. You can preserve and restore a Cast a Spell action, but if you don't cast the same spell when you Restore the Moment, you become stunned 1 (you can Cast the Spell at a different rank, though). FRACTURE TIMEFLOW FEAT 18 INCAPACITATION MYTHIC OCCULT Prerequisites Timewracked Dedication Your ability to interact with and even observe the flow of time allows you to fracture it slightly in a localized place whenever you land a particularly solid blow on a foe. Whenever you achieve a critical success with a Strike, the target of that Strike must also attempt a @Check[will|against:class-spell] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You gain one additional piece of information about the creature, as if you had critically succeeded at the Recall Knowledge check.</p>"
