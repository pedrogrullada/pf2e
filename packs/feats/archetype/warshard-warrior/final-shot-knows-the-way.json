Spend a Mythic Point, then Stride twice. At any point during this movement, attempt a ranged Strike at mythic proficiency with your warshard weapon against the same foe you already attacked this round. This Strike ignores any modifiers from cover or concealment the target may have, as the ammunition weaves and twists through the air in an impossible flight. All penalties from range increments are negated during this Strike. If this shot hits its target, the target is so astounded by the shot that they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] until the end of your next turn.</p>"
