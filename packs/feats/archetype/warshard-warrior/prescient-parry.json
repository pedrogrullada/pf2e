Your warshard weapon intervenes at the last second, rising to deflect the incoming blow. For this attack, calculate your AC at mythic proficiency, then add any item bonus from your weapon to that value. If the attack misses and the target is within your reach, or if your warshard weapon is a ranged weapon and the target is within the weapon's first range increment, you can Strike the creature who made the triggering attack with your warshard weapon.</p>"
