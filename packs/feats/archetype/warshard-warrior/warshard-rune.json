Choose one common weapon property rune that's of a level equal to or lower than your level. That rune is applied to your warshard weapon as if it were etched onto it normally, but this weapon property does not count against the normal maximum number of property runes a weapon can have. If you empower a weapon with a property rune of the same type, only the highest-level one applies. This additional rune functions only when you wield your warshard weapon and have at least 1 unspent Mythic Point; otherwise, the rune becomes dormant until these conditions are met.</p>"
