Spend a Mythic Point. Your weapon gains the thrown trait with a range increment of 40 feet; if your weapon already has the thrown trait, increase its range increment by 40 feet. Make a ranged Strike at mythic proficiency at an opponent within range. For this ranged Strike, apply your full Strength modifier to the damage, as if it were a melee Strike. After the Strike resolves, the weapon flies back to your hand, and you can then attempt a melee Strike (at your normal proficiency, not mythic proficiency) against a target in reach of your weapon. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both attacks.</p>"
