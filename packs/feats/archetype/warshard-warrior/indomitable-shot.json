Spend 1 Mythic Point, then fire a single shot from your ranged warshard weapon. You inflict your weapon's damage on all creatures in a line, to a maximum distance equal to your weapon's maximum range or until the line hits a solid object that's either thicker than 5 feet or has a Hardness in excess of 20, whichever comes first. Each creature in the area attempts a @Check[reflex|against:class-spell|basic] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, calculated at mythic proficiency. For each range increment beyond the first, a creature gains a cumulative +2 circumstance bonus to their Reflex save. This ability counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.</p>"
