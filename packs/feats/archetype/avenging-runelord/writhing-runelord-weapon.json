Spend a Mythic Point. Your weapon gains the reach trait until the end of your turn, if it doesn't have it already. You can Stride and Strike twice, in any order. The movement from your Stride doesn't provoke reactions. Your Strikes are made at mythic proficiency and gain the critical specialization effect of the weapon. Apply your multiple attack penalty to your Strikes as normal, but the target of your second Strike is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] to it.</p>"
