They may blaze brightly, leave lingering fog, create discordant noise, or fill the air with an overwhelming scent, such that their presence obfuscates you from onlookers. You gain concealment from enemy creatures until the beginning of your next turn. The DC to identify your spells as you cast them is 2 higher than normal.</p>"
