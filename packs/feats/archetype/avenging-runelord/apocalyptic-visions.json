You've learned to endure the invasive thoughts of this empire-ending event, but now you can project that despair into the minds of others. Spend a Mythic Point and target up to 10 creatures within 60 feet that you can sense. You force images into their minds of Earthfall, forcing them to endure a vision of the end of the world and all they hold dear. The creatures must attempt a @Check[will|against:class-spell] save against your class DC or spell DC using mythic proficiency, whichever is higher.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is so distracted by the visions that they are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is slowed 1 and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} for 1 minute. In addition, the creature suffers the effects of the spell nightmare the next time it rests. If the creature fails or critically fails against this effect, the effect repeats each time the creature attempts to sleep until it succeeds on its save or 6 days have passed. You do not need to know the creature's name or remain on the same planet for the creature to experience these nightmares.</p>"
