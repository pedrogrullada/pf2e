This previous life might be the return of an animal companion or familiar a previous PC of yours had that perished, or it could be the reincarnation of an entirely different legendary creature. It could even be the returning spirit of a close friend or ally who stood by your side. If you have an animal companion, it gains one specialization of your choice. If you have a familiar, it gains two additional familiar abilities. If your fated companion is slain, you can replace it at no cost when you perform your daily preparations.</p>"
