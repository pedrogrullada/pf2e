Pain and agony brought on by your foes can be endured and even turned back upon them when you feel yourself at death's door. Whenever you have the doomed, dying, or wounded condition, you gain that condition's value as a status bonus to damage rolls when you make melee or ranged weapon Strikes. If you have multiple conditions, only the highest value condition counts for setting the amount of this damage bonus. You also gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Share Death's Promises] free action.</p>"
