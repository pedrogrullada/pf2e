You can see in all directions simultaneously and therefore can't be flanked. If you're not holding your weapon, this ability fails if your warshard weapon is on a different plane than you. If you spend a Mythic Point as part of this action, you attempt saving throws against visual effects at mythic proficiency while observing through your warshard weapon. You can observe through your weapon for up to 1 minute or until you open your eyes as a free action, whichever comes first.</p>"
