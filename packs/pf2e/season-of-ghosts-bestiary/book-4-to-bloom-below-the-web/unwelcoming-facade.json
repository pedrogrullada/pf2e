In addition to this temporary immunity, the creature can attempt a @Check[occultism|dc:23] or @Check[religion|dc:23] check as a free action to notice that despite there being only one face in the facade, several spiritual echoes seem to infuse the building. On a critical success, the creature realizes that only the most powerful force infusing the manor is evil and that the other elements are non-hostile spirits who are overwhelmed and trapped by that singular force.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature experiences a brief vision of the manor's facade twisting into an immense, horrific face and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1}. The creature can attempt the same @Check[occultism|dc:33] or @Check[religion|dc:33] check as above, but the DC increases to 33.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2} and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] for as long as it remains frightened. The creature can attempt the Occultism or Religion check to Recall Knowledge normally (DC 33).</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature can't reduce its frightened condition below 1 for 1 minute. In addition, the overwhelming fear causes the creature to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1}; this condition persists until it's cured magically or the hazard is disabled.</p>"
