For two hours, they hammered a lump of ordinary steel into a divine blade, etching constellations and wards down its length, then shared their creation's formula with a small group of close associates before passing away.</p>\n<p>These weapons are the four-tiger blades, and currently, only a dozen are known to exist—one associated with each month of the year. Each weapon is a <em>+2 striking ghost touch longsword</em> that leaves a noticeable trail of light originating from the engraved stars when it's swung. Those who pay close attention to the pattern of stars that shine on the blade might note that the depicted constellations change according to those currently in the night sky above.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Ghost Blocking Tiger</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You attempt a Strike with the four-tiger-blade</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Until the start of your next turn, you gain void resistance 10.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.V7cIpoJL9Zm4TiUT]{Effect: Four-Tiger Blade}</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Ghost Chasing Tiger</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, divine, incapacitation, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Attempt a Strike against a creature you believe to be possessed.
