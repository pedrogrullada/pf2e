When you activate a traveler's fulu, the magic infuses your mind with sensations of deja vu, as if you'd been in this region before. Your attempt to Sense Direction functions as if you have a compass, and you use the outcome one degree of success better than the result of your Survival check to Sense Direction, or by two degrees of success if you're a master in Survival.</p>"
