If the target is an ally, your words inspire them and they gain 10 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute. If the targeted creature is an enemy and the spell requires a saving throw, and if the enemy fails its saving throw, they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} as a result of despair and sadness.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Juubun's One Thousand Poems]</p>"
