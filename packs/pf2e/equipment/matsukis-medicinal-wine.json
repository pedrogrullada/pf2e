In addition to making you tipsy, this medicinal wine works wonders in helping to recover from disease. When you drink a dose of this wine you must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:18] save to avoid becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] for 10 minutes (and also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} for this duration if you critically fail the saving throw). Regardless of the saving throw's results, you gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons for the next 24 hours. This applies to your daily save against a disease's progression as well.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Matsuki's Medicinal Wine]</p>"
