You gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.MJx7DmjsWYzDZ3a4]{Phantasmagoria} as an occult innate spell that you can cast once per day.</p>\n<p>When you gain this feat, choose any two of the following damage types: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, poison, slashing, or sonic. These damage types caused your deaths more often than not in your previous lives, and whenever a creature takes damage from a <em>phantasmagoria</em> spell you cast, you can swap the mental damage that spell normally causes for one of the two damage types you chose.</p>"
