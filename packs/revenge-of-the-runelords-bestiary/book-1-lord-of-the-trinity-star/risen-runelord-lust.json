Once created, a risen runelord has no capacity to become more powerful, as they are manifestations of their legacy at a specific point in time (although given enough time and resources, a risen runelord could potentially find a way to overcome this limitation on self-improvement).</p>\n<p>A risen runelord has a modicum of free will, but as long as the one who created them via raise runelord lives, they're bound to their creator's desires. A risen runelord ordered to undertake obviously self-destructive actions might, at the GM's discretion, resist the command and could potentially even break free of their creator's control.</p>\n<p>Since raise runelord draws upon a runelord's legacy as it exists within the Dreamlands, no risen runelord can ever sleep or dream. Xanderghul can use a risen runelord in a special way: he can use any risen runelord (including ones he didn't create) as a spare body. If he's slain, his soul can instantly jump to the closest risen runelord to replace them and continue the fight, unless the PCs can disable this defense during the second adventure in Revenge of the Runelords. Regardless of level, all risen runelords are mythic creatures and are immune to sleep effects.</p><h2>Lust and Pride</h2><p>Of the seven sins, lust and pride are unique among the runelords for these sins were only ever represented by a single runelordâ€”and both still live during the events of this Adventure Path. This may change once the events of Revenge of the Runelords come to a conclusion, in which case the sinful foci for lust and pride become potential options for risen runelords of Sorshen or Xanderghul, but during Revenge of the Runelords, no risen runelords of lust or pride can exist.</p><h2>Risen Runelord Gear</h2><p>A risen runelord's polearm is an extension of their being and cannot exist without them, vanishing upon their death. This doesn't prevent a risen runelord from claiming, carrying, or using other items, and most higher-level risen runelords keep real magic items that remain behind after their death.</p>",
